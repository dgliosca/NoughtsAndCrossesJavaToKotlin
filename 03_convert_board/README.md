The task is to convert the class Board from Java to Kotlin.

Be aware that the conversion is not always smooth, and the code may not compile.

- In Kotlin streams API are different from the Java one.
- java.until.List in Java is mapped to kotlin.collections.MutableList in Kotlin
- What happened to the types when you did the conversion?
